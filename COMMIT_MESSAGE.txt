feat: Add Android 16 KB page size support for Google Play compliance

This commit implements all required changes to support 16 KB memory page sizes
on Android 15+ devices, as mandated by Google Play starting November 1, 2025.

Changes include:

Build System Upgrades:
- Upgraded Gradle wrapper from 8.10.2 to 8.11.1
- Upgraded Android Gradle Plugin from 3.5.4 to 8.6.0
- Updated Kotlin JVM target from 11 to 17
- Added Java 17 compatibility settings (sourceCompatibility & targetCompatibility)

16 KB Page Size Configuration:
- Added packagingOptions with useLegacyPackaging=false for proper native library alignment
- Created Application.mk with APP_SUPPORT_FLEXIBLE_PAGE_SIZES flag for NDK r27
- Configured build to support 16 KB memory page sizes on 64-bit devices

Dependency Updates:
- Updated React Native from 0.77.0-rc.6 to 0.77.1 (stable release)
- Updated react-native-reanimated from 3.16.1 to 3.19.3
- Updated react-native-gesture-handler from 2.20.2 to 2.25.0

- Updated all React Native dev dependencies to match 0.77.1

These changes ensure the app:
- Meets Google Play's mandatory 16 KB page size requirement
- Properly aligns native libraries for 16 KB devices
- Maintains backward compatibility with 4 KB page size devices
- Benefits from performance improvements on modern Android devices

Testing Required:
- Build verification on all architectures
- Functional testing on Android 15 emulator with 16 KB page size
- Regression testing on 4 KB devices (Android 14 and below)
- Verification using: adb shell getconf PAGE_SIZE (should return 16384)
- APK alignment check: zipalign -c -P 16 -v 4 app.apk
